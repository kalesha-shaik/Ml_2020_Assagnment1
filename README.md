Ml 2020 Assignment 1


## objective of your chatbot :
My bot takes input from the farmer i.e crops and price of the crops etc... 
and displays it to the buyer.
so the buyer can directly contact the farmer.


## Paragraph about my chatbot : 
Now a days everyone are are earning money and becoming rich..
but except a farmer, 
this is because of mediator between farmer and buyer .
the mediator buy a product at cheap cost from the farmer and sells at high cost to the buyer. here both farmer and buyer are not getting benefited..
        so i come up with a solution where both farmer and buyer gets communicated and buy the product and farmer will gain much money as well as buyer can save some money.
this Chatbot provides farmer information and product information of farmer ......and buyer will get data from our platform and communicate with farmer.
